# Notes

## Primary objectives:
- Evaluate multiple genotypes based on their traits
- Calculate Multi-Trait Score to assess overall performance for each genotype.
- Use PCA to visualize phenotypic or genetic variability among genotypes.
- Select three genotypes that combine:
- high performance/quality (Multi-Trait-Score) and
- High genetic diversity  (PCA)


## Multi-Trait Score
 
We wanna combine several meaningful traits into a single numerical value that reflects the overall performance of each genotype.
This score is based only on traits that show clear and significant! genetic variation.
 
### BLUP = Best Linear Unbiased Prediction
A statistical estimate of the genetic performance of a genotype. BLUPs represent the genetic value of a genotype for a trait!

Corrects for:
- environmental effects
- replicate/block effects
- random error
 
### EBLUP = Estimated BLUP
- This is simply: EBLUP = BLUP + grand mean
- BLUPs alone are centered around zero so they are sucky to read
- EBLUPs shift the predictions back to the original trait scale, making them comparable and interpretable.
- For PCA and multi-trait scoring, EBLUPs are typically used so we are doing that, too.
 

## Traits Included in the Multi-Trait Score
Only traits with a significant genotype effect (p < 0.05)
 
Included traits (BLUP/EBLUP used):
- SQI (Seed Quality Index) this I have calculated using the measured traits from the seed quality sheet they provided
- CCM (Chlorophyll Content)
- HGW (Hundred Grain Weight)
- Fresh Mass (FM) 
  - "After sampling" was incomplete and I left it out because I didn't see the use of it.
- Dry Weight (DW)
- Plant Height (PH) 
  - Not sure about this one, I extracted the BLUPs and EBLUPs… differences were significant too, but is it really a genotypical trait or an environmental one instead?

## Traits Excluded from the Multi-Trait Score
I excluded them because the genotype had no significant effect on the trait (Flowering Time) or because I was uncertain.
 
Flowering Type (FT): Genotype had no significant effect on flowering type
BBCH stage: See questions below


## What I did so far:
 
- Extracted BLUPS and EBLUPS for the relevant traits
- Calculated Means for FT and BBCH in case we want to use them for PCA
- Put the data into an excel file for overview

## What needs to be done:
 
1. Deciding which PCAs are useful and relevant
2. Sorting and categorizing traits to decide which will be used in which PCA
3. Doing the PCAs
4. Calculating the Multi-Trait Score
5. The presentation itself obviously
6. Probably loads more shit I’m not thinking of rn

## Questions (bad) :
 
- Which traits do we include in the PCAs?
- Do we include only EBLUPS in PCAs? Or can means be used from traits that have no effect on genotype? 
  - Maybe BBCH and FT for developmental PCA? DOES THAT EVEN MAKE SENSE?
- What kind of PCAs are we gonna do?
 
 
### BBCH:
- How do we handle this trait? Is it influenced strongly genetically or is it environmental?
- Is it a performance trait? Or a diversity trait? Phenological diversity vs perfomance quality?
- Is higher BBCH = Better? Or should it only be included in a developmental PCA?
- Honestly same questions regarding Plant Height. But isn't BBCH ordinal and PH continuous??




## Questions (good):
(Qs I would like to answer with PCAs)
 
- Which of these traits explain most of the performance variation?
- Which genotypes perform similarly across all traits?
- Are high-scoring genotypes diverse or not? Are top-performers clustering tightly or spread out?
- Do some traits co-vary?
- Are there like.. How do you say in english? Trade-offs? Like High something but low something else?
