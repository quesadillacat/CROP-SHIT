# Instructions

## Your Presentations
Your presentations should take 10 min, so 5 min per person, plus 10 min
questions from the audience (including me). The ability to answer questions
will be taken into account.
Each group will have a different set of plants, so your results will all be a bit
different.
**Your task is to select three accessions as donors for a future breeding
program on winter oilseed rape.** They should be genetically as diverse as
possible, but still be as adapted as possible.
In your presentation, you have to justify your selection.

## Your Data
You will have two data sets: phenotyping data from today as well as
genotypic data from next time (3./4. 12.25). Both can and should be used for
the presentation. There is no rule of how you distribute the work among
you, as long as both of you are presenting.
If you want more data, feel free to ask for it – the diversity set has been
heavily used in research in the last decades…

## Scoring
- Structure of the talk (2)
- Description of methods (2)
- Scientific quality of the figures, tables etc. (2)
- Arguments for selection (4)
- Presentation style (3)
- Ability to answer questions correctly (2)

## Which Traits Are Measured And Why?

### Seed Quality

> „Wild type rapeseed contained different antinutritive compounds, limiting use as
feed or food.
>
Discovery of the accession ‚Liho‘ in 1963 with
strongly reduced content in erucic acid lead to
the development of ‚0 rapeseed‘ – suitable for
human consumption.
>
Shortly afterwards, discovery of the accession
‚Bronowski‘ with reduced glucosinolate
content allowed development of ‚00 rapeseed‘
– suitable as animal feed and turning rapeseed
into a profitable crop”

**Takeaway:** seed quality corresponds with lower antinutrients like erucic acid 
and glucosinolate content.

### Seed Weight

> „Hundred grain weight is an important yield component”

**Takeaway:** Oilseed rape harvests the seed of course, so we want them as big and
(getting to this with yield later) as many of them per plant as possible.

### Plant Height And Biomass (Fresh And Dry)

> „Plant height and biomass are indicators of source capacity”

**Takeaway:** TBD

### Plant Development

> „Plant development needs to be perfectly synchronized”

Question for us to answer: What development do we want for this type of crop?
Is faster development actually worse?

**Takeaway:** TBD

### Chlorophyll Content

> „Chlorophyll content is a measure of N supply and stress level”

Question for us: What chlorophyll content is optimal for WOSR?

**Takeaway:** TBD

## Plant Material
> „I selected 12 diverse accessions of
Brassica napus (rapeseed) from a
larger diversity set (>500
accessions).
They were grown in the
greenhouse in pots in 5 replicates
under Standard conditions for 5
weeks. Details can be found in the
document
„MP258_plant_cultivation.pdf“.”

# Notes

## Primary objectives:
- Evaluate multiple genotypes based on their traits
- Calculate Multi-Trait Score to assess overall performance for each genotype.
- Use PCA to visualize phenotypic or genetic variability among genotypes.
- Select three genotypes that combine:
- high performance/quality (Multi-Trait-Score) and
- High genetic diversity  (PCA)

# TO-DO List:
- Interpret the data from the Practical 2 script
- -> Subpopulation differentiation: Where exactly does the genetic variation come from, what are those genes?
- Find out how BBCH plays into all this
- Calculate the multi-trait-score
- Decide for genotypes based on variation and performance.
